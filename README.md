Juju Dashboard displays your controllers and models, allowing you to see the
status of your deployments, manage access, run actions and configure
applications. The dashboard can be used with your local Juju environments and
can also be found as a part of [JAAS](https://jaas.ai/).

## Deploy

Juju Dashboard can be deployed in your controller model using either the [VM charm](https://charmhub.io/juju-dashboard)
or [Kubernetes charm](https://charmhub.io/juju-dashboard-k8s) (pre Juju 3.0
controllers included Juju Dashboard automatically).

To deploy the dashboard, first switch to the controller model:

```shell
juju switch controller
```

Next deploy the charm. For VM deployments run:

```shell
juju deploy juju-dashboard dashboard
```

For Kubernetes deployments run:

```shell
juju deploy juju-dashboard-k8s dashboard
```

Then integrate the controller and the dashboard:

```shell
juju integrate dashboard controller
```

Finally, expose the dashboard:

```shell
juju expose dashboard
```

Now you can access the dashboard by running:

```shell
juju dashboard
```

This command will open a connection to the dashboard output the dashboard address and
credentials.

For further details see the docs on [managing the dashboard](https://juju.is/docs/olm/manage-the-juju-dashboard).
